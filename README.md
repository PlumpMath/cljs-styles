# cljs-styles

Vendor prefixes for React inline styles with ClojureScript.

Suitable for use with Quiescent and Reagent at least, since they use clojure
maps with their React.

## Install

Add `[cljs-styles "0.1.1"]` to `:dependencies` in your `project.clj`.

This is truly a zero-point release. I don't know how, if or when this API will
change. Use with care, open an issue with any questions.

## Usage

```clojure
(:require [cljs-styles.core :as styles])

(styles/prefix {:transition "all"})

;; => {:msTransition "all"
;;     :WebkitTransition "all"
;;     :MozTransition "all"
;;     :transition "all"}
```

Optionally list what prefixes to include:

```clojure
(styles/prefix {:transition "all"}
               #{:webkit})

;; => {:WebkitTransition "all"
;;     :transition "all"}
```

There's also a convenience `styles` macro, which lets you use non-camel cased
css names. It also only wraps the map in a `prefix` call if any of the keys
need prefixing.

```clojure
(styles/styles
 :background-color "#fff"
 :transition "all")

;; => {:backgroundColor "#fff"
;;     :WebkitTransition "all"
;;     :transition "all"}
```

Please note! It passes only `:webkit`, since that's my usecase right now.

## Limitations and laziness

- there's no runtime check of what prefixes to add, since I'm using this on both
  the server and client. You can check the browser and pass in a suitable set of
  prefixes if you want.

- I haven't added support for `calc`, since it's a hassle to fix and also best
  avoided due to bad performance in the browser.

- Some values need prefixing, like `cursor: -webkit-zoom-in;`.
  [React doesn't support these very well](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2020),
  and I haven't investigated all values that need this. I've added the hack from
  the previous link for `display: flex`, since I need that. Notice a trend? It's
  version 0.1 indeed.

## Keyframes

There's also support for creating and prefixing keyframes for CSS animations.

```clojure
(use 'cljs-styles.keyframes)

(render-keyframes
  "fade-in"
  [[  0 "opacity 0;"]
   [100 "opacity 1;"]])

;; => @-webkit-keyframes fade-in {0% {opacity 0;} 100% {opacity 1;}}
;;    @keyframes fade-in {0% {opacity 0;} 100% {opacity 1;}}
```

There's even a handy macro `defanim` that creates stylesheets dynamically:

```clojure
(defanim half-rotate
    [  0 "transform: rotate(0);"]
    [100 "transform: rotate(180);"])

;; used like this

(d/div {:style {:animation-name half-rotate}})
```

This will create a `style` tag and populate it with the keyframe rules. The name
(`half-rotate` here) resolves to the name of the animation.

This macro cannot be used on the server at the moment. I'm planning to do
something about that.
